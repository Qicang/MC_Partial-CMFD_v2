\begin{frame}{Afterwords}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item A lot of multilevel methods are being implemented. However, be cautious about using more power iterations or more aggressive Wielandt shift in feedback problems, especially on the coarsest space/energy grid.
    \item Be comfortable with a partially convergent NDA (CMFD). If it helps, just use it.
    \item A batch of MC particle simulation/deterministic source iteration is a power iteration, pencil-paper results suggest that we should avoid running a lot batches/source iterations in MC/deterministic codes before applying feedback.
